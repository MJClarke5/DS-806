It is the middle of summer, and Elizabeth has some decisions to make for the next Fall clothes line up for
her clothing line Chakra. She has a meeting with her production manager Eddy, and they will finalize next
month’s production plan. She has already goten most of the work completed. She has paid 8 designers
$850,000 for the design of next season’s line up. She has also spent $2,900,000 for the four fashion
shows where the new line will be displayed. This includes all the costs from the models, to
choreographers, to make-up and hair artists to music and lighting and venue costs. The designs, the
prices the products will sell at, their material and production costs have also been determined by her
team
